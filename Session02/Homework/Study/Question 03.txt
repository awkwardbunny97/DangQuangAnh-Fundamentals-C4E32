Question: What is nested conditionals? Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals?
	
	Answer: Nested conditions comprise condition statements contained within the definition of other condition statements. Nested conditions work as follows:

			You can group multiple condition statements. Conditions consisting of multiple statements 
			are connected using the logical AND and OR operators.

			You can also nest statements, so that one statement is contained within the definition
			of another statement.

	Example: x = 10
		 	 y = 10

		if x < y:
    			print("x is less than y")
		else:
    			if x > y:
        			print("x is greater than y")
    			else:
        			print("x and y must be equal")
